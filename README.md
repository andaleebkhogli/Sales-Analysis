# Sales-Analysis 📊

Sales Analysis & Dashboard Project using SQL & Power BI

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository contains a data-analysis / business-intelligence project built using SQL and Power BI. The objective is to process sales data, transform and clean it, then build interactive dashboards that provide insights and key performance indicators (KPIs) to support data-driven decisions.

Specifically, this project demonstrates how to extract, transform and load sales data, compute core KPIs (such as total sales, top products, top customers, sales vs. budget, trends over time) and present them in a user-friendly, interactive dashboard — useful for sales managers, analysts, or business stakeholders.

## 📊 What This Project Delivers

* Cleaned and prepared raw sales data using SQL and Power Query.
* Defined core KPIs and calculated metrics: total sales, sales vs budget/target, top products, top customers, sales trends over time.
* Built interactive dashboards in Power BI, with filtering by time period, products, customers, and other dimensions.
* Created multiple report views / dashboards: e.g. Sales Overview, Customer Analysis, Product Analysis (or similar, depending on project).
* Documentation of business requirements, user stories, and data-processing / transformation logic.
* Screenshots for quick review (in case viewer doesn’t have Power BI installed).

## 📥 How to Use / View the Dashboard

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Restore or set up the database using the provided SQL / setup files under `1. Database Setup Files/`.
3. Open the Power BI file(s) from the `4. Data Visualization Power BI/` folder*.
4. If you don’t have Power BI, you can inspect the dashboard via screenshots provided under `5. Screenshots/`.

* If your data connection changes (e.g. database credentials, server name, or schema), you may need to update the data source settings inside Power BI accordingly.

## 🎯 Why This Project Matters

* Demonstrates end-to-end data-analysis workflow: from raw data to cleaned data, from transformation to actionable business insights.
* Useful as a portfolio piece showcasing skills in SQL, data modeling, BI-tool usage, and business insight generation.
* Serves as a starter template (or base) for more complex analytics or reporting dashboards — you can reuse its structure for other datasets or business domains.

## ✅ Possible Improvements / Future Enhancements

* Add automated ETL pipeline or scheduled data refresh (if using live database)
* Add documentation of data dictionary: explain tables, fields, meaning of KPIs / measures
* Add more dashboards or reports (e.g. region-wise sales, product category trends, customer segmentation)
* Add export or sharing functionality (e.g. PDF, Power BI Service, or web-embedded dashboards)
* Add a README “Dashboard Preview” section with embedded images or links (if publishing publicly)
